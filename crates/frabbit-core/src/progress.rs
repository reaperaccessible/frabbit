//! Progress-event plumbing for the install pipeline.
//!
//! The setup pipeline is normally silent until its final [`SetupReport`] is
//! returned: callers see a finished result, not the per-package boundaries
//! along the way. UIs that want a live progress bar need finer-grained
//! signals — which package is being downloaded right now, how many bytes
//! have arrived, when each install phase finishes. [`ProgressReporter`]
//! threads an opt-in callback through the pipeline so callers can wire one
//! in without forcing the existing API (CLI, tests, embedded callers) to
//! pass a sentinel through every function in the chain.
//!
//! Threading: the callback fires on whatever thread is currently driving
//! the pipeline — the worker thread for the wxdragon UI, the calling
//! thread for the CLI. The closure must therefore be `Send + Sync`. UIs
//! that need to touch widgets cross-thread are expected to forward events
//! into their own UI thread (e.g. via `wxdragon::call_after`).
//!
//! Event-rate guarantees: stage events (`Started` / `Completed`) fire at
//! most a handful of times per package; the [`ProgressEvent::Download`]
//! byte-progress events are throttled by the download loop to roughly one
//! per 200 ms or per 256 KiB, whichever is rarer — UI threads should not
//! get more than ~5 events per second per active download even on a fast
//! LAN.
//!
//! [`SetupReport`]: crate::setup::SetupReport
