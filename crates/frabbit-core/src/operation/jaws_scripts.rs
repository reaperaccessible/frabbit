//! Per-package automation hooks for the JAWS-for-REAPER scripts.
//!
//! Upstream ships an NSIS self-extracting installer (the file we get from
//! `hoard.reaperaccessibility.com` is `Reaper_JawsScripts_NN.exe`). The
//! installer:
//!
//!   * Drops `Reaper_ComAccess32.dll` and `Reaper_ComAccess64.dll` into
//!     `%APPDATA%\REAPER\UserPlugins\` (the standard REAPER UserPlugins
//!     folder — paths are hard-coded inside the NSIS script).
//!   * Detects the installed JAWS version + interface language and copies
//!     the script files (`reaper.JSS`, `reaper.JSB`, `*.jcf`, sounds, …)
//!     into the matching `%APPDATA%\Freedom Scientific\JAWS\<ver>\Settings\<lang>\`.
//!
//! Because all of that lives inside the NSIS script (which runs the
//! `JAWSSetupUtility.dll` plugin to pick the right JAWS slot), FRABBIT doesn't
//! need to replicate any of that logic — we just launch the installer
//! interactively with elevation and verify the standard REAPER UserPlugins
//! side landed afterwards.
//!
//! **Why not silent (`/S`)?** NSIS's silent flag suppresses the main wizard
//! window but does not suppress modal dialogs from NSIS plugins. The
//! `JAWSSetupUtility.dll` plugin embedded in this package opens an invisible
//! "JAWS detected, pick a language" dialog at install time, and silent mode
//! turns that into a hang because the dialog can never receive a click. We
//! launch the installer interactively (no `/S`) so the user can step through
//! it; the existing UAC consent prompt + the wxdragon `WaitForSingleObject`
//! in the elevated runner mean FRABBIT still pauses until the installer exits
//! and the freshness verification still catches a no-op run.
//!
//! The installer hard-codes the standard REAPER `%APPDATA%\REAPER` path, so
//! a portable REAPER target won't receive the `Reaper_ComAccess*.dll` files
//! — that's a real limitation, but matches what users get if they run the
//! installer manually. We still let the package run for portable targets so
//! the JAWS-side scripts do get refreshed; the verification path falls back
//! to the per-user JAWS Settings file in that case.
