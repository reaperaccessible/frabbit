/// it reports whether the *querying* process is translated, and the
/// shelled-out `sysctl` binary always runs as the host's native arch
/// (the kernel picks its native slice at exec time, regardless of the
/// parent's translation state). The shell-out therefore always
/// reported `0`, even when the *parent* FRABBIT process was running
/// under Rosetta. Calling `sysctlbyname` from inside FRABBIT itself
/// fixes that: the kernel resolves the value against the calling
/// thread's translation state, which is what the dispatcher needs.
