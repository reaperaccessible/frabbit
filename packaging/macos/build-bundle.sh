# FRABBIT ships unsigned (no Apple Developer Program enrollment). This helper

#
#   1. Clears `com.apple.quarantine` from Frabbit.app and every file inside

#      afterward.
#
#   2. On macOS 15 (Sequoia) and 26 (Tahoe), removing the xattr is no longer
#      sufficient: Gatekeeper still blocks first-launch of unsigned/ad-hoc
#      bundles regardless of quarantine state. The only path is the one
#      Apple intends — let the launch attempt fail, then approve via
#      System Settings -> Privacy & Security. To make that one-click for
#      the user, the helper triggers the launch (so an entry appears in
#      that settings pane) and immediately deep-links the pane.

macOS likely showed a security warning instead of launching Frabbit.
That's expected for unsigned apps on macOS 15 and later. To approve:

  1. Dismiss the security warning (click "Done").
  2. In the Settings window we just opened, scroll to the "Security"
     section near the bottom of Privacy & Security.
  3. Click "Open Anyway" next to the Frabbit entry.
  4. Confirm with your password or Touch ID if asked. Frabbit.app
     will launch.

This approval is per-app, not per-launch — once you've clicked
"Open Anyway", future double-clicks on Frabbit.app work normally.
FRABBIT's self-update replaces the binary in place under the same bundle
identity, so updates inherit the approval; only a fresh download into a
different location triggers the dance again.
